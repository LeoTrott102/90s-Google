# 90s-Google
An unofficial 90s Google app for Windows 3.1 up to Windows 10! Just have an internet connection and Internet Explorer (Or a browser of your own choice)!





Have fun and help me improve! This only took me 5 minutes to create, and just out of curiosity. This is a GREAT example if you are starting to learn Visual Basic as even though it was written in Visual Basic 6.0, it is still relevant today* *Slightly





Enjoy and tweet me @ComputingTug of you using it and improvements you've contributed to this repo! - Leo ;P
